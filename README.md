# EMCM - Exotic Monte Carlo Engine
A MC engine to price exotic derivatives, with implementations in both Python / C++. The reason to code it up in two languages: 
* Both are languages commonly used in quantitative finance - implementing a solution in both languages provides a way to learn the intracicies of both languages from bottom-up.
* The languages themselves carry different benefits - Python (usually) provides a quicker and smoother development cycle where C++ provides the raw speed where there is demand for performance.

Contributions are *more* than welcome!
